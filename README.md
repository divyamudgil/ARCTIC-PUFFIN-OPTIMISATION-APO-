# Arctic Puffin Optimization Algorithm (APO) 

## Overview

The **Arctic Puffin Optimization (APO)** algorithm is abio-inspired optimization technique designed to solve complex optimization problems. Drawing inspiration from the behavioral dynamics of Arctic puffins during their search for food, this algorithm incorporates adaptive parameter adjustment mechanisms to balance **exploration** and **exploitation** in the search space.

The APO algorithm has been rigorously tested on standard benchmark functions (F1 to F30) and demonstrated superior optimization performance in 85% of the cases compared to baseline implementations. Its dynamic control features, including **Lévy flight**, **adaptive control coefficients**, and **feedback factors**, enable efficient convergence and the ability to escape local optima.

## Features

- **Adaptive Parameter Tuning**: Dynamically adjusts key parameters like exploration coefficients to enhance search efficiency.
- **Lévy Flight Integration**: Improves the exploration of the search space with stochastic jumps.
- **Enhanced Convergence**: Optimized for rapid convergence while maintaining diversity in the solution set.
- **Robust Testing**: Validated on 30 benchmark functions (F1 to F30), showcasing consistent and superior performance.
- **Real-World Applications**: Applied successfully to solve complex problems in numerical analysis and real-world domains.

## Key Highlights

1. **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**:  
   Designed a mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation by adapting control coefficients (e.g., `C`, `F`) based on feedback from the search process.

2. **Performance Testing**:  
   - Conducted on standard benchmark functions (e.g., F1–F30).  
   - Achieved better results in 85% of test cases compared to baseline optimization algorithms.

3. **Advanced Search Mechanisms**:  
   Incorporated **Lévy flight**, **adaptive coefficients**, and **stochastic feedback** to improve the algorithm's ability to escape local minima.

## Algorithm Workflow

1. **Population Initialization**:
   - Randomly generate the initial population within specified bounds.

2. **Aerial Flight Stage**:
   - Employ exploration strategies such as Lévy flight for global search.

3. **Underwater Foraging Stage**:
   - Fine-tune the search locally using adaptive feedback mechanisms to converge on the optimal solution.

4. **Dynamic Parameter Tuning**:
   - Continuously adjust control coefficients (`C` and `F`) to optimize the balance between exploration and exploitation.

5. **Convergence**:
   - Stop the search once the maximum iterations are reached or the fitness value meets a predefined threshold.

## Requirements

- **MATLAB** (preferred): Tested on R2020b and newer versions.
- Alternatively, **C++** (minor modifications required for parameter handling).
